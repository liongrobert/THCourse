Commands

ls -l - List files in long format, including permissions info
chmod - Change the permissions (mode) of a file or directory
rwx notation

In ls -l, each file has a 10 character permission representation such as drwxrwxrwx. Each character represents a permission on the file. If the letter is replaced with a dash (-), it indicates the permission is not granted. For example -rwxr-xr-x.

The first character denotes if it is a dirctory. d means directory, -, means not a directory.

The next 9 characters can be grouped into triplets of rwx. The leftmost triplet is for the owner of the file, the middle is the group owner, and the right is permissions for others. rwx stand for the read, write, and execute permissions, respectively.

Octal notation

You may read or set permissions using a 3 digit octal number. The digits represent the owner, group, and other permissions, from left to right. Each digit may be 0 through 7 representing the different combinations of read, write, and execute.

To compute what each digit means, use this formula.

read/r = 4

write/w = 2

execute/x = 1

For each permission you want to grant, sum their corresponding values.

chmod g+w filename
chmod o+x filename
chmod o-x filename
chmod 777 filename 





chown - Change the owner of a file or directory.
